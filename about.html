      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      As the official K-12 outreach arm of Rensselaer, we play a unique role in providing service to the Capital Region in STEM education. Rensselaer values and practices multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches in curriculum, teaching, and outreach, emphasizing interactive learning, the generative use of technology and teamwork to involve students as active participants in their own educations. CIPCE enacts this vision in our work with K-12 students and teachers, working toward improving STEM education to help our society meet the challenges and seize the potential of the 21st century.
