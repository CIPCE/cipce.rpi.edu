			Teacher Professional Development 
			</div><br/>
			<div>
			A focus on STEM education is one which calls for the integration of the knowledge and skills in the
			disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics to provide a meaningful, authentic
			learning experience.  Any reform in education needs to affect the practice of teachers, as teachers
			are the single-most important factor (among many) that influence K-12 students' learning. CIPCE's 
			major activities focus on developing and implementing professional development initiatives for teachers. 
			These initiatives engage teachers in inquiry-based approaches to teaching in the STEM disciplines,
			aligned	with common core and state standards, making use of 21st century tools and contexts. 
			<br/><br />
			<strong>An Integrated Approach to Teaching Mathematics Using LEGO&reg; Robotics in Middle School and Mathematics
			Education College Courses,</strong> has been funded by the U.S. Department of Education's Fund for the
			Improvement of Postsecondary Education (<strong>FIPSE</strong>).  
			</div><br />
			Teacher Cohort:<br/>
			<div>
			We work with a group of highly accomplished teachers, many National Board Certified, who teach in
			grades 4-8 general education, mathematics, technology and science, from ten diverse school district
			in New York state. Mentor teachers work with colleagues in their building who share an interest in
			enriching their classroom experience with Robotics activities.
			</div><br />

			Project Targets:<br/>
			<div>
			Teachers design and implement mathematically rich lessons for NXT LEGO&reg; Robotics using a common framework. Lessons are aligned to the NYS Common Core Learning Standards in Mathematics, provide a physical, real-world context, and aim to authentically assess student learning. Modules are field-tested, revised and shared via our educational resources section.
			</div><br />
			Teacher Testimonies:<br />
			<div>
			<em>"Students attended to detail and precision in this activity to a degree that I have not 
			experienced in other activities. ... I saw a lot of students discussing with their group 
			how to collect the data most efficiently and accurately." </em>- 7th grade science teacher 
			<br/><br />
			<em>"Students were able to take the current event article of the Curiosity rover on Mars
			and apply math concepts of ratio and proportions by collecting data and then converting 
			unit rates." </em> - 8th grade technology teacher
			<br/><br />
			<em> "I thought that only the more tech-savvy students would be interested but, much to my
			delight, I saw that just about every single student was excited and actively engaged.
			I have come to better understand the inquiry process & it is a powerful tool that 
			 allows students to discover math rules as opposed to me telling the students them
			  and then practicing." </em> -7th grade math teacher
			<br/><br />
			<em> "Almost all students used multiplication to gat a multiple of 360 degrees as their
			prediction - without me telling anyone to do this. ...After seeing how excited my 
			students, and other teachers, have been about the robotics program, it has inspired 
			me to keep doing more.  I am also looking forward to having other teachers that I work
			 with participate so we can bounce ideas off each other." </em> - 4th grade teacher<br /><br />

			 Modules developed by the cohort can be viewed and downloaded by visiting our Ed Resources page. 
			</div><br /><br />


			<div> <strong>NYS Teacher and Leader Quality Partnership Grant (TLQP)</strong> is
			funded by the <strong>New York State Education Department.</strong> This grant aims to improve mathematics
			education in grades 3-8.
			</div><br />
			Teacher Cohort:<br />
			<div>
			Teachers involved in this project teach math at the grades 3-8 level in two school 
			districts and two New York State designated 853 schools serving students with 
			disabilities in the Capital Region.
			</div>
			<br />
			Project Targets:<br />
			<div>
			Participating teachers use assessment data and interactive technologies, both physical
			and virtual, to engage students in deep mathematical thinking and math literacy, which
			 will help them master the common core standards.  While collaborating with colleagues,
			  teachers have opportunities to deepen their knowledge of math and how to use a variety
			   of tools to facilitate interactive, inquiry-based teaching serving the diversity of 
			   students they teach.
