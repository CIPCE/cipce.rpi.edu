	        Students will merge their creative interest in LEGO® TECHNIC building elements with their “technological life styles.” Participants will use the LEGO® EV3 technology to design, construct and program robotic solutions to complex engineering challenges. Input from sensors will permit robots to autonomously navigate around obstacles or retrieve objects. Students will leave with an understanding of the relationships and common themes that connect mathematics, science and technology, and they will be able to integrate these principles into their everyday life. Participants will be using an iconic programming language. This software, combined with the planned curriculum, creates a fun, fast-paced and exciting introduction to robotics!

	        <br>
	        An Iconic programming language will be used to manipulate sensors on a more advanced level than the LEGO Robotics Engineering Academy. Students will be taught how to use several types of coding structures including loops, if-then statements and variable manipulation through a series of mini-challenges. The experience will culminate in a final challenge that will ask the students to creatively incorporate the variety of skills they have learned during the session. This program stresses team building and collaboration requiring students to work in groups in most situations. This experience is directed towards students with previous backgrounds in LEGO® robotics or participation in an after school robotics program or FIRST LEGO® League participation or participation in a previous Rensselaer Robotics Engineering Academy session. Advanced LEGO® EV3 is facilitated by Rensselaer undergraduate students under the direction of professional Rensselaer faculty and staff.

	        <br>
	        Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and a development environment for writing software for the board. It uses inputs and outputs to sense its environment and allows students to create devices that affect its surroundings. Participants will be introduced to the applications of a microcontroller including the interfacing of electronic components throughout the course. Arduino is the most popular open-source microcontroller that has a programming language built on C and C++. A lot of programming and circuitry building is involved in this program. Students must have enthusiasm for circuitry and programming.
	        <br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>What you will Learn</strong>
	        <br>
	        By learning Arduino, students will learn basic circuitry, along with the programming skills necessary to embed intelligence into a system. By accomplishing small interactive projects, this program will offer students a basic understanding of how electronics work and will learn to use controllers to operate LED lights, actuators, sensors, and so much more!

	        <strong>What you will Learn</strong>
	        <br>
	        VEX Robotics is for those who love to create, experiment and build their own inventions! This program provides a hands-on, project-based, intense engineering experience designed to educate and inspire students ages 13-16y to pursue academics or a career in STEM. Experience in programming or attending a past LEGO® program is not required. VEX Robotics is facilitated by Rensselaer undergraduate students under the direction of professional Rensselaer faculty and staff.
	        <br>
	        VEX Robotics builds upon LEGO® Robotics technology by reinforcing engineering principles while introducing additional levels of complexity. A VEX system includes metal construction pieces, wheels, sensors and motors. The robots are controlled by a remote control transmitter or by programming a microprocessor that is built into the robot. This allows students of various skill levels to continually be challenged while using the system. The robot can be programmed in both a visual version of C programming called easyC and the C programming language itself. Students work in teams to design and create VEX Robots that can accomplish engineering challenges.
	        <br>
	        Students will have one week to work in a team to design, build and program a robot. RPI student instructors will allow students to learn through experimentation. These robots will have to navigate through an obstacle course. The course will challenge students to create a robot that can identify, move, lift and push objects around. Students may also be presented with problems that encourage them to learn how to balance speed with power in order to construct the most maneuverable robot.
