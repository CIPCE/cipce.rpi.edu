<h2>Teaching Modules aligning Common Core Learning Standards in 
  Mathematics (CCLSM) Using LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 &amp; NXT</h2>
<p> The following modules are teacher constructed.  These 
  are a free resource in efforts to foster inquiry and integration in STEM 
  education. You may be able to adapt to other grade levels. The module 
  plan is listed as “UBD,” which stands for Understanding By Design, 
  developed by Grant Wiggins &amp; Jay McTighe.  You can download a copy 
  of a blank <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-fhRJBYebkLalppckNiSHp0aEU">UBD template</a>.
  Many modules contain coding instructions, which teachers developed 
  and should be useful, although we don’t guarantee they are perfect. Feel free to contact our center with questions and feedback regarding your experience implementing the modules</p>

      random distances a robot will travel) with equivalent means, 
      students will investigate whether or not the mean alone adequately 
      characterizes a data set. Following this, students will calculate a 
      predicted outcome given a set of parameters. They will
      then obtain a number of actual outcomes for the same set of 
      parameters to discover the distinction between expected result 
      (theoretical probability) and real result (experimental probability).

      <br /><strong>key terms:</strong> Ratio, Rate, Probability, Graphing, Speed and Proportions
      <br /><strong>summary:</strong> Students will record ideas from informational text on the 
      Curiosity Mars Rover, and model the Rover with a LEGO NXT Robot, 
      manipulating the time and measuring the distance traveled. After 
      recording the data, This real-world activity will reinforce how fractions, 
      ratios and unit rate are related to identify equivalent fractions and 
      proportional relationships.
